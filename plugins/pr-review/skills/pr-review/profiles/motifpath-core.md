# Profile: motifpath-core

## Identification

- Repository / path scope: `motifpath/motifpath-core` — monorepo, both `services/core-domain/` and
  `services/event-ingestion/` (see `profiles/ROUTING.md`).
- Local reference repo: `motifpath-core` checkout, root `Makefile` / `devbox.json` / `.golangci.yml`
  for shared tooling.
- Comment language: English.
- Stack in one line: Go, hexagonal architecture, Postgres (core-domain, via `ent`), MongoDB Atlas
  (event-ingestion), oapi-codegen, clerk-sdk-go/v2.

## Sources of intent

- Spec: OpenAPI paths in `motifpath-specs/openapi/` are the source of truth for every HTTP contract;
  event shapes in `motifpath-specs/openapi/components/schemas/events.yaml`.
  (`motifpath-core/CLAUDE.md` — Spec-Driven Development)
- Gherkin scenarios: `motifpath-specs/features/*.feature`, run via `godog` (`make test:bdd`).
- Backlog item: task code in the branch name (`feat/MTP-NNN/...`), per the `git` skill.
- Fallback: ask the user for the activity's context.

## Local norms (with evidence)

| Norm | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Hexagonal layering: `internal/domain` (zero deps) → `internal/application` (use cases) → `internal/ports` (interfaces) → `internal/adapters/{http,repo}` | `motifpath-core/CLAUDE.md` — Hexagonal Architecture |
| Business logic never lives in HTTP handlers; handlers call application services only | `motifpath-core/CLAUDE.md` — Layering Rules |
| Dependency direction is inward — domain/application never import adapter packages | `motifpath-core/CLAUDE.md` — Layering Rules |
| Domain events are emitted only from the application layer, never adapters/handlers | `motifpath-core/CLAUDE.md` — Layering Rules |
| `ThresholdOverride` takes precedence over a `Node`'s default threshold, applied in the application layer | `motifpath-core/CLAUDE.md` — Domain Model |
| `internal/adapters/http/generated/` is oapi-codegen output — never hand-edited; regenerate via `make generate` | `motifpath-core/CLAUDE.md` — Spec-Driven Development |
| No cross-service Go package imports between `services/core-domain` and `services/event-ingestion`; shared code (if any) lives in root `shared/` and must stay non-domain-specific | `motifpath-core/CLAUDE.md` — Monorepo Boundaries |
| JWT validation goes through one `clerk.Client` per service via `clerk-sdk-go/v2` — no custom JWKS fetch/cache logic (ADR-009) | `motifpath-core/CLAUDE.md` — Auth |
| Errors are always handled explicitly — never a blank `_` on an error return; no `interface{}`/`any` | `motifpath-core/CLAUDE.md` — Code Quality |
| No request-validator middleware runs, and oapi-codegen 2.4 generates no enum checks, so an enum query parameter reaches the handler unchecked. When the spec answers an unknown enum value with 400, does the application layer (or the domain filter) reject it, or does the query just return an empty list? | `cmd/main.go` wires no OpenAPI validator; the generated `BindQueryParameter` only checks the format. Found in core#66 (`?kind=`, `?type=`); `exercise_type` on `/exercises` still had the gap |

## Boundaries

- **Public contract:** any HTTP handler shape or event schema field — breaking either requires an
  OpenAPI/event-schema version bump in `motifpath-specs` first (Spec-Driven Development).
- **Tolerated legacy:** none documented yet — ask the user before treating anything as
  grandfathered.
- **Automatic gates (don't re-flag):** `golangci-lint` via the committed `.golangci.yml`
  (`make lint`); the 80% coverage gate on `internal/application/` packages; `//nolint` without an
  inline reason is already a lint-time concern, but confirm the reason is *specific*, not generic,
  since the linter only checks presence, not quality.

## Tests

- Live at the service layer only: `internal/application/`. (`motifpath-core/CLAUDE.md` — Testing
  Discipline)
- Table-driven, `testify`, one test function per feature, one row per scenario.
- Database tests use `testcontainers` — mocking the repository layer is explicitly disallowed, so a
  test that only manipulates a mocked repo is itself a finding (Axis E, item 18).
- Gherkin scenarios from `motifpath-specs/features/` run via `godog`, `make test:bdd`.
- Naming: describe the behavior under test, never a ticket ID or incident number.

## Delivery

- Feature/fix/chore branches target `dev`; only `hotfix/BUG-NNN/...` branches from `main` directly.
  (`motifpath-core/CLAUDE.md` — Branching, mirrors the `git` skill)
- `make generate` (oapi-codegen API stubs) is always its own `chore(codegen)` commit, separate from
  business logic, per the `git` skill's atomic-commit rule.
- **Practiced divergence (confirmed 2026-09-28, core#58 review):** an `ent` schema change ships in
  one commit together with its regenerated `ent` code, its `make migrate:diff` migration (ADR-010),
  and the repository code and integration test that use it (e.g. `dbdbd8f`, `dc75172`, `47df522`
  on `dev`). Don't flag that bundle as a mixed commit; do flag a schema/migration change bundled
  with application or handler logic.

## Bootstrap notes

Seeded from `motifpath-core/CLAUDE.md` on 2026-08-25. First live review: core#58 (2026-09-28) —
the migration-commit norm was checked against `dev` history and corrected above; the rest is still
unconfirmed. On
first real review in this repo, walk the Bootstrap steps in `_TEMPLATE.md` (read 2–3 files per
layer, read a mature module's tests, check recent merge history) and update this table with any
divergence between the documented and the practiced pattern.
