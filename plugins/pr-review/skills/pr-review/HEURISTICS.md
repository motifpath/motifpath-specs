# Systemic checklist

Questions, not rules: a question crosses languages and repos; a rule dies with the framework. Each
item carries the **question** that triggers a finding + the **smell** that signals a problem.

**Mindset:** step out of the changed line and hold the change against three axes the diff itself
doesn't show — **the system** (who calls in, where the output lands), **real data** (volume,
cardinality, how hostile the content actually is), and **the lifecycle** (rollout, migration,
reprocessing — not just steady-state).

## Activation

22 items is too many for every review. Classify the change and walk only the activated subset —
plus the five always-on items.

| If the change… | activates |
|---|---|
| alters behavior that already exists | 10, 11, 12, 13, 4 |
| creates a new entry point or a new output | 1, 15, 7, 14 |
| touches ordering, filtering, scoring, or aggregation | 10, 5, 6 |
| touches an identifier, key, name, or path | 8, 9 |
| reuses an existing routine in a new context | 3, 5, 6 |
| adds validation or a constraint | 11, 12, 13 |
| carries external content into render/query/exec | 15, 16, 2 |
| touches configuration, migration, or rollout | 7, 14, 2 |
| is user-facing (motifpath-web) | 12, 18, 14 |
| **always** | **17, 19, 20, 21, 22** |

## Axis A — The system around it

1. **Call chain (source → destination).** Who builds the input, and where does the output get
   written/rendered/persisted? — *Smell:* a function reviewed in isolation, without opening its
   caller or where the output lands.
2. **Symmetry and precedent.** One path gained a guard/optimization — did its sibling paths get it
   too (e.g. `core-domain`'s read path vs. its write path; `event-ingestion`'s Kafka consumer vs.
   its HTTP producer)? Does the project already have a solution for this? — *Smell:* a guard
   present in one direction of a pair and absent in the other; a twin module already solved this
   and it was ignored here.
3. **Reuse fit.** Does the reused routine return what I need, or does it carry weight (fields,
   ordering, no limit) my caller doesn't use — and does it change the scale it was built for? —
   *Smell:* reusing something built for dozens of items on a path that sees thousands.
4. **Second-order effect / invariant.** Does the change alter a guarantee other code assumes? —
   *Smell:* "just optimized," "just swapped a parameter," with no map of who depends on it. In
   `motifpath-core` this is explicitly the monorepo boundary: does a change quietly make
   `core-domain` and `event-ingestion` depend on each other?

## Axis B — Real data

5. **Distribution, not example.** What's the real volume and shape of the data in production
   (generic values repeated in nearly every row, the largest collection, the max allowed limit)? —
   *Smell:* reasoning anchored to the spec's clean example payload.
6. **Amplification and cost.** 1 event/request → how many operations? Multiply by fan-out **and**
   by the trigger's frequency (e.g. one `exercise.answer_sent` event fanning out to a threshold
   check per node). — *Smell:* a serial loop calling something with N round trips, no limit.
7. **Absence and transitional state.** What if the input is empty/null/duplicated? And **during**
   rollout (field not yet migrated, event not yet reprocessed, an old client version still in
   flight)? — *Smell:* only the happy path covered; no "doesn't exist yet" case.
8. **Normalization destroys uniqueness and information.** Shortened/normalized/hashed an
   identifier: what guaranteed uniqueness before, and what guarantees it now? Does the destination
   accept a duplicate **silently**? What does whoever operates it lose for debugging? — *Smell:*
   truncation/hash with no dedup at the destination.
9. **Sentinel value inside the deterministic space.** Does the "unknown" fallback share the same
   key space as real values? — *Smell:* a sentinel producing a stable key that never invalidates.

## Axis C — The nature of the change

10. **Additive or mutating?** Does it add a new capability, or **change existing behavior** (order,
    filter, scoring, format — e.g. the threshold-override precedence rule)? Mutating requires a
    test that **locks** the behavior, not just a test of the new case. — *Smell:* a criterion
    change with no before/after comparison test.
11. **New constraint on an existing door.** Are all callers of that entry point already editing the
    field that just became validated? Payloads that resend the whole state carry fields the caller
    never touched — validating X starts rejecting a legitimate edit to Y, and legacy invalid data
    blocks unrelated flows. Validating **only when the field changed** usually fixes it. — *Smell:*
    validation added without enumerating callers and payload shapes.
12. **Every entry door for the data, with a reason.** Does the new rule apply at **every** point
    where the data is edited, and is the new error contract shown at **every** caller? A block with
    no explanation is a dead end: prefer validating in the action with an actionable message over
    silently disabling a control. — *Smell:* protection at 2 of N points; a helper created with
    half the rule while the other half stays duplicated elsewhere.
13. **Same rule, two sides.** A rule computed in two layers (client and server, cache and origin —
    e.g. threshold logic duplicated in `motifpath-web` and `motifpath-core`) diverges in some
    scenario: a config read failure, a different default, a limit applied on one side only? —
    *Smell:* two defaults for the same rule, in different files.
14. **Surface beyond the code.** Do docs, runbooks, migrations, config, and operator communication
    belong to this change? — *Smell:* new behavior with no trace outside the code.

## Axis D — Untrusted input

15. **Trail from input to a sensitive destination.** Does third-party-editable content
    (student/teacher-entered text, exercise answers) reach a destination that interprets it raw
    (render, query, exec, template, file path, header)? Where exactly is it neutralized? Who writes
    that input, and at what scale? Once you find one vector, **generalize to the other producers of
    the same destination.** — *Smell:* interpolating external content with no explicit
    neutralization step on the path.
16. **Tool semantics before copying the fix.** Does the fix that works here apply globally to a
    block/scope and break a legitimate neighboring case? — *Smell:* copying a fix without reading
    what the option actually does.

## Axis E — Reviewer method

17. **Verify, don't presume.** Did you claim "this is sanitized," "this path populates the field,"
    "the API guarantees order"? Open the code and confirm. — *Smell:* a conclusion about unread
    code.
18. **Test the real path.** When the claim depends on runtime behavior, exercise it through the path
    a real caller/user takes — test shortcuts that inject state internally bypass the actual
    mechanism. — *Smell:* a suite that only manipulates internal state and never fires the real
    event (e.g. never actually emits `lesson.completed`).
19. **Existing discussion is context.** List **all** discussion (bot, human, prior rounds, resolved
    and open), actually paginated, and dedupe before drafting. The criterion is "thread without a
    reply," never "recent comment." — *Smell:* a draft proposing something a thread on this same PR
    already resolved.
20. **Concurrent, mutually exclusive changes.** Is another PR under review touching the same design
    decision in the opposite direction? Merging one forces undoing the other — decide the direction
    **first** and look for a synthesis that satisfies both. — *Smell:* "known conflict, we'll sort
    it out later."
21. **Does the description describe the current state?** After a mid-review pivot, does the text
    still describe the earlier version? Is an instruction for reviewers in the description, where
    it's looked for, or lost in a thread? — *Smell:* description contradicting the diff.

## Axis F — Comment hygiene

22. **Does a comment explain the code, or point away from it?** A code comment names an ADR, PBI/
    backlog item, ticket, or spec file instead of stating the invariant, constraint, or reason in
    its own words. The rationale belongs in the code; the document is where that rationale was
    decided, not where a future reader should have to go to find it. — *Smell:* "per ADR-NNN," "see
    PB-NNN," or a bare doc-name reference standing in for an explanation — it goes stale the moment
    that document is archived, renamed, or renumbered, and it costs every future reader (human or
    AI) an external lookup to understand code sitting in front of them. Doc references belong in
    commit messages and PR descriptions, which are allowed to age — never in the comment itself.

## Budget

**Cap: 24 items.** Adding at the cap requires merging two neighboring items or cutting the weakest
one first (`LEARNING.md` §2) — a judgment call made by re-reading the checklist, not by usage data.
The restriction is intentional: a 40-item checklist doesn't get reviewed, it gets skimmed.

A new item here **only** enters after passing the filter in `LEARNING.md` §1: it has to survive
without this repo's stack, phrase as a question, and be falsifiable. Never add a rule that's really
just a fix specific to one PR — if it doesn't generalize, it doesn't belong here.
