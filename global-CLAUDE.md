## Communication
Always respond in English.
Be concise and direct — prefer short explanations with code examples over long prose.
When something is ambiguous, ask one focused clarifying question before proceeding.

## Spec-Driven Development (all MotifPath repos)
The spec exists before the implementation — always.
If the spec doesn't exist yet, the feature is not ready to implement.
Check motifpath-specs before writing any handler, component, or business logic.

## Code Quality Principles
Explicit over implicit — prefer clear, readable code over clever code.
Small functions with a single responsibility.
NEVER leave TODO comments without a linked issue.
NEVER suppress linter warnings without an inline explanation.

## Testing Principles
Tests describe behavior, not implementation.
A test that only passes because of mocks isn't testing anything real.
If a test is hard to write, the code design is probably the problem.

## MotifPath Project Map
Four repositories under the motifpath org:
  motifpath-specs   → contracts (OpenAPI, Gherkin, events, prompts, evals, ADRs)
  motifpath-core    → Go monorepo (core-domain + event-ingestion services)
  motifpath-web     → Vue 3 frontend (students and teachers)
  motifpath-infra   → Terraform (EKS, RDS, MongoDB Atlas, ECR)

Specs always change before code. Code always references specs.
When in doubt about a business rule, check motifpath-specs/features/.
