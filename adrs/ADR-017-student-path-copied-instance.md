## Context

The learning-path model was built for a single active path per student. `LearningPath` +
`LearningPathItem` hold a path definition; `PathAssignment` links one student to one path by
reference, with a `UNIQUE(student_id)` constraint; assigning a new path deletes the old
assignment and resets progress. `GET /students/me/path` returns "the" active assignment. The
student path is already meant to be self-contained (ADR-015) — but today it is self-contained
only by *reference*: every student on a given path shares the same `LearningPathItem` rows.

Two forces make this model wrong, not just limited:

1. **A revised product premise.** MotifPath's MVP validation and student retention must not
   depend on external teacher supply. The team is the concierge — building paths and producing
   the basic content — and the platform must show standalone value first. Retention is a product
   responsibility: a student who finishes their one path with nowhere to go is a cliff the
   product itself has to answer. This revises the earlier "teacher quality is the leverage
   point" framing (teacher leverage remains the *scaling* thesis, not an MVP dependency) and is
   recorded separately in Product HQ.

2. **The path must be individualised per student, and a student needs more than one over time.**
   A generic path — e.g. a beginner path every new student starts from — is a *template*. Each
   student's path is that template **copied** and then personalised by the concierge (steps
   added, removed, reordered; sections relabelled) without touching the template or any other
   student. Students will also hold several paths — parallel tracks now, a next path after
   finishing one — with one being the path they are actively working. "Paths as courses" (a
   catalog with teacher-mediated multi-enrollment) is a live direction, deferred past the alpha.

A third force is where the per-student state lives. "Student" is a role on `User`, not a
subtype — teachers and admins share the table. Path state hung directly off `User` would be
columns that are always null for non-students: an invalid state the schema would be able to
represent. This ADR resolves it here rather than deferring it.

The database has **no production data**. There is no migration cost and no reason to model
minimally — the model can be designed correctly now.

Alternatives considered: (a) keep the reference model, add a nullable `deactivated_at` to
`PathAssignment` so reassignment is non-destructive (an earlier draft of this ADR) — rejected
because it leaves every student on a path sharing one set of item rows, so per-student
personalisation is impossible; (b) one path table with a `template` boolean discriminator —
rejected because templates and instances have different lifecycles, different editability, and
only instances carry progress; (c) copy the template into a per-student instance — chosen.

## Decision

MotifPath will model a student's path as a **copied, independently-owned instance of a reusable
template.**

**Two definitions:**

- **`LearningPath` / `LearningPathItem` — the template.** A reusable path definition: an
  ordered list of items, each an immutable `content_node_id` plus an optional `section_label`
  (ADR-015). No student, no progress. Authored once; reused across many students.
- **`StudentPath` / `StudentPathItem` — the instance.** Created by copying a template's items
  for one student. Belongs to exactly one student. Independently editable after creation. Fields
  on `StudentPath`: `id`, `student_id`, `source_template_id` (the `LearningPath` it was copied
  from, for provenance), `title` (copied, then editable), `assigned_by`, `assigned_at`,
  `archived_at` (nullable). `StudentPathItem`: `student_path_id`, `position`, `content_node_id`,
  `section_label`.

**`PathAssignment` is removed.** "Assigning a path to a student" *is* "copy the template into a
new `StudentPath`". The assign operation: copy the template's items into a new `StudentPath`,
and point the student's current path at it (see below).

**A student has many `StudentPath`s.** Accessibility is one axis: a `StudentPath` with
`archived_at IS NULL` is *active* and visible to the student; a non-null value hides it (a
concierge/admin action — distinct from "not the one I'm working on right now").

**The "current" path is a pointer in a student-scoped table, never a column on `User`.** A
student is a `User` with role `student`; teachers and admins are the same table. Path state —
the current-path pointer, and anything student-only that follows it — lives in a new
`StudentLearningState` table (`student_id` primary key referencing `User`,
`current_student_path_id` nullable FK), which has a row only for users who are students. Adding
`current_student_path_id` directly to `User` would let a teacher or admin row carry path state
that is meaningless for them — an invalid state the schema should not be able to represent.
`StudentLearningState` is the standing pattern for role-scoped state: a per-role extension
table keyed by `user_id`, not a class hierarchy (ent has no inheritance) and not nullable
columns on the shared identity row. `current_student_path_id` may be null (a student between
paths, or with everything set aside). Invariant, enforced in the application layer:
`current_student_path_id`, when set, references a `StudentPath` that belongs to that student and
is not archived. Assigning a path sets it as the student's current path. Archiving the current
path clears or moves the pointer.

**Per-node completion stays keyed by `(student, content_node)`** — unchanged from ADR-011. The
Aggregation Worker continues to derive node-completion state per student, not per path. A
`StudentPathItem`'s status (`completed` / `in_progress` / `not_started` / `locked`) and the
path's `current_position` are **derived at read time** from those student-level completion
facts plus the item order — exactly as `BuildStudentPathItems` does today, now reading the
copied `StudentPathItem` rows instead of `LearningPathItem`. A consequence the concierge must be
aware of: a content node that a student already completed in an earlier path shows as
`completed` the moment it appears in a newly copied path ("you already learned this").

**Template edits do not propagate.** A `StudentPath` is a point-in-time copy. Changing a
`LearningPath` never changes an existing `StudentPath`. A "pull updates from the template"
action is explicitly out of scope.

**The MVP surface is unchanged in shape.** `GET /students/me/path` stays singular — it resolves
the student's `current_student_path_id`, returns that `StudentPath` with its derived per-item
status and `current_position`, and 404s when the pointer is null. The response field
`assignment_id` becomes `student_path_id`. No multi-path list endpoint, no catalog, no
enrollment UI in this decision — those are the two deferred backlog items ("Student path model
— copied instance, multi-path, running-path lifecycle" tracks the near-term implementation;
"Path catalog & teacher-mediated multi-enrollment" is the deferred epic).

This ADR **supersedes the earlier (never-accepted) draft of ADR-017** that proposed a
`deactivated_at` column on `PathAssignment`.

## Rationale

- **Copy over reference** is the only model that lets the concierge individualise a path
  without a per-student override table bolted onto shared template rows. It also makes ADR-015's
  "self-contained sequence" literally true, and makes template deletion safe (no instance
  depends on it).
- **Separate template and instance tables** because they diverge on every axis that matters:
  the template has no owner and no progress and is edited by content authors; the instance has
  one owner, derives progress, and is edited by the concierge for that student. A discriminator
  column would force every query and constraint to special-case the two.
- **Pointer on the student, not a `running` status on the path.** With completion tracked at
  `(student, node)`, a `StudentPath`'s progress state is almost entirely derivable — the only
  non-derivable per-path fact is "is this the one the student is working on". Putting that one
  fact in one place (`StudentLearningState.current_student_path_id`) keeps each `StudentPath`
  row free of mutable focus state and makes "switch current path" a single write. The cost — a
  pointer that must stay consistent with path archival — is contained by an FK plus one
  application-layer guard.
- **Completion at `(student, node)`, not `(student_path, node)`**, because "has this student
  learned this content" is a student-level truth, and re-teaching a node the student already
  completed is not the goal. It also leaves ADR-011 and the Aggregation Worker untouched. The
  trade-off — a freshly copied path can render partly pre-completed — is acceptable because the
  concierge chooses the copy's contents and because showing known material as already done is
  the desired behaviour, not a bug.
- **Deriving `StudentPathItem` status at read time** rather than storing it keeps a single
  source of truth (the completion facts) and means the copy operation only copies structure,
  never state.
- **Student path state in a role-scoped table, not on `User`.** "Student" is a role, not a
  subtype, so any state that only students have (starting with the current-path pointer) would
  be a nullable, always-null-for-non-students column if placed on `User` — a representable
  invalid state. A `StudentLearningState` extension table keyed by `user_id` makes the invalid
  state unrepresentable and sets the pattern for later per-role state (a `TeacherProfile`, say)
  without reaching for inheritance ent does not support.

## Consequences

### Positive
- The concierge can personalise each student's path freely; the template and other students are
  unaffected.
- A student can hold many paths; adding multi-path browsing, a catalog, or enrollment later is
  additive — no schema migration, because the instance model and the per-student pointer are
  already in place.
- `LearningPath` templates can be edited or deleted without touching any student's path.
- ADR-011 and the Aggregation Worker are unchanged; completion stays `(student, node)`.
- The MVP read surface and the derived-status logic are essentially as they are today.
- The `User` row stays role-agnostic; `StudentLearningState` cannot exist for a non-student, so
  the schema cannot represent a teacher or admin "holding a path".

### Negative / Trade-offs
- A substantial `motifpath-core` change: new `StudentPath` / `StudentPathItem` /
  `StudentLearningState` schemas, a copy-on-assign operation, removal of `PathAssignment`, and
  the `assignment_id` → `student_path_id` rename through the API and Gherkin. Cheap only because
  there is no data.
- Assigning a path is now an N-row copy rather than a single insert — negligible at MVP scale,
  but no longer O(1).
- `current_student_path_id` is a second piece of state to keep consistent with `archived_at`;
  a bug can point "current" at an archived or foreign path. Mitigated by the FK and a single
  application-layer guard, and by tests.
- A newly copied path can render with steps already `completed` if the student did those nodes
  elsewhere. Intended, but the concierge must understand it, and onboarding a brand-new student
  from a beginner template is the common case where it does *not* surprise anyone.
- Retained archived paths and per-student path copies grow storage and widen the surface a
  student data-erasure request must sweep (now `StudentPath`, `StudentPathItem`,
  `StudentLearningState`, plus completion facts).
- Two near-identical item shapes (`LearningPathItem`, `StudentPathItem`) to keep in step when
  the item structure changes (e.g. a future per-item field).

### Neutral
- `student_path_id` changes on every reassignment (a new copy), preserving today's contract
  that reassignment yields a fresh identifier.
- "Paused" / "not started" / "completed" for a `StudentPath` are derivable from item completion
  and need not be stored; only `archived_at` is stored state on the accessibility axis.

## Related ADRs

- **ADR-015** (Challenge belongs to the path node; the student path is a self-contained
  sectioned sequence) — this ADR makes that self-containment literal by copying the sequence per
  student; `section_label` is copied per item.
- **ADR-011** (Minimal Aggregation Worker for MVP node-completion state) — unchanged; completion
  stays keyed by `(student, content_node)`, and `StudentPathItem` status is derived from it.
- **ADR-005** / **ADR-010** (Atlas + ent migration workflow) — the schema changes follow this
  workflow; since there is no data, the initial migration can be regenerated rather than
  layered.
